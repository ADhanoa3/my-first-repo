# Welcome to MATH 4330: Numerical Analysis!

Welcome to Numerical Analysis with Dr. De Silva! This repository will serve as your first step into a world that unites mathematics and computer programming. Below you will find information about the course and the structure of this **repository**.

>ðŸ’¡ A **repository** is a central place where all the files and folders related to a specific project are stored and managed. It allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and keep a history of your work.

## Course Overview

In this course, we will explore various numerical methods used to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically. You will learn about:

- Approximation of derivatives and integrals
- Solving linear and non-linear equations
- Numerical solutions of differential equations
- Interpolation and curve fitting
- Eigenvalue problems

All of these numerical methods will be implemented using the programming language **Python**. In this repository, we will learn some of the syntax and fundamental data structures in Python.

## Repository Structure

Here is a brief overview of the repository structure:
```

- **homework/**: Contains the instructions and template files for the assignment. You will edit the template files directly to complete the homework.
- **README.md**: Is this file you are reading right now.
- **class_notes.ipynb**: Is what you will edit directly to write notes during class.
