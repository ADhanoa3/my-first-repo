# 2. Use a built-in function to calculate the sum of the list numbers and set it to the variable sum_numbers.



# 3. Print to the console Sum of all numbers: # where # is the value of sum_numbers.



# 4. Use the variable sum_numbers and another built in function to calculate the average of the list numbers.
# Set the average to the variable average_numbers.



# 5. Print to console Average of numbers: # where # is the value of average_numbers.



# 6. Use built-in functions to find the maximum and minimum numbers in the list numbers.
# Set the values equal to max_number and min_number, resepctively.



# 7. Print to console Maximum number: # where # is the value of max_number.



# 8. Print to console Minimum number: # where # is the value of min_number.
