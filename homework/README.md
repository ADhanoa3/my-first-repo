# Homework Instructions

Below the __init__.py file, you will see three Python files with the following names: task_1.py, task_2.py, task_3.py. Each of these Python files contains a task for you to complete. To complete the task, edit the file directly and commit changes as you make them. **Do not edit the contents of any of the other files**.
