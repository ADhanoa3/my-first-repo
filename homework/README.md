# Homework Instructions

Below the __init__.py file, you will see one Jupyter notebook file with the name homework_scratch.ipynb and three Python files with the following names: task_1.py, task_2.py, task_3.py. Each of these Python files contains a task for you to complete, those tasks have been copied into the Jupyter notebook. To complete the task, edit the **.py** file directly and commit changes as you make them. You may use the Jupyter notebook for scratch work, but **your final code needs to be in the corresponding .py file**. Do not edit the contents of the __init__.py and README.md files..
