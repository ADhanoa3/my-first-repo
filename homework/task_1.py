# Task: Complete each step below to print an exponentiation result to the console.

# 1. Define two variables, called a and b, with numerical values of your choosing.



# 2. Define a third variable called result which is the result of raising a to the power of b.
# The variable result should be defined in terms of the variables a and b.



# Print to the console Result: # where # is the value of the result variable.
# For example, if a and b are 2 and 3 respectively, then the variable result should be 8
# and Result: 8 should be printed to the console.
