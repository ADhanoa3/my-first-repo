# Complete this task by adding lines of code underneath this comment block.
# For your first task, define two variables called a and b with numerical values of your choosing.
# Then define a third variable called result which is the result of raising a to the bth power.
# The variable result should be defined in terms of the variables a and b.
# Print to the console Result: # where # is the value of the result variable.
# For example, if a and b are 2 and 3 respectively, then the variable result should be 8
